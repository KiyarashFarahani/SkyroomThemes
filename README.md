# SkyroomThemes By Kiyarash Farahani
Applies on skroom.online , which is a web conferencing system used in Iran's schools and universities during the pandemic.
I hope you enjoy this theme.
To apply my themes follow these steps:
  1. install Stylish Extension ( Available for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en) & [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) )
  2. Look for a puzzle icon on the top-right corner of your browser, click on it, find Stylish from the list & open it.
  3. click on Agree, & click on the power icon if it's gray, otherwise it's turned on already.
  4. Open [This Website](https://userstyles.org/styles/browse?search_terms=Kiyarash%20Farahani&type=false) & You'll see my themes
  5. Choose one and open it, then click on Install Theme.
  6. Done :]
